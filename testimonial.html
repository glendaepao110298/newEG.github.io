                <li>    I am thrilled to share my experience with the ICT training sessions held every Saturday. Despite of my busy schedule and financial challenges, I am proud to say that I have successfully completed the program. Throughout this training, I have gained invaluable skills in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint presentation, and creating simple webpages using CSS and HTML. These new skills have greatly enhanced my capabilities and confidence in using technology for educational purposes. The sessions were well-structured and provided hands-on experience that made complex concepts easier to understand. I learned how to efficiently manage data in Excel, create engaging presentations in PowerPoint, and develop basic yet functional webpages with HTML and CSS. This knowledge will significantly contribute to my role as an ALS Implementer, allowing me to integrate technology more effectively into my teaching methods. I am immensely grateful for this opportunity and the support from the trainers and my peers. This journey has been transformative, boosting not only my technical skills but also my confidence. I look forward to applying these skills to further support and empower others especially to my future learners, ensuring that they too can benefit from the power of technology in education. Thank you to everyone who made this training possible. Your dedication and effort have made a lasting impact on my professional development.
